These are some architectural principals that I have worked under, and
set out myself on certain projects which I believe will stand the test
of time in any Enterprise Archicture:

**Name: Service Orientation**

*Statement*: The architecture is based on a design of services which
mirror real-world business activities and perform discrete parts of larger
business processes.

*Rational*: SOA provides a interoperable set of services which are
loosely coupled to platform and technology.

*Implications*: Facilitates re-use, integration and improves deployment flexibility within a distributed environment.

 

**Name: Minimialist Architecture**

*Statement*: Only make small architectural decisions that are needed to
be made based on the current level of scope to achieve the business strategy.

*Rational*: The architecture cost for a delivery is only what is needed.

*Implications*: Drives the IT Roadmap transitions

 

**Name: Technology Independance**

*Statement*: The architecture should not be based on a specific
technology platform or be defined by a vendor solution.

*Rational*: The architecture needs to develop and grow as business
requirements evolve. The solution must not be controlled by the
suppliers of the physical environment or application servers.

*Implications*: This principle will require standards which support
portability. Subsystem interfaces will need to be developed to enable
legacy applications to interoperate with applications and operating
environments developed under the enterprise architecture. Middleware
should be used to decouple applications from specific software
solutions.

 

**Name: IT Responsibility**

*Statement*: The IT department is responsible for owning and
implementing IT processes and infrastructure that enable solutions to
meet requirements, service levels and delivery timescales.

*Rational*: Effectively align expectations with capabilities and costs
so that all projects are cost-effective. Efficient and effective solutions have reasonable costs
and clear benefits.

*Implications*: Process control is required to prioritise projects. The
IT function must define processes to manage business unit expectations.

 

**Name: Data is king.**

*Statement*: Data stored in our systems are of upmost importance and
sensitivity.

*Rational*: Data is the foundation of our business and it is important
that we can rely upon it and gain access to it when needed.

*Implications*: Process and policies must be put in place by the IT
function to ensure access control is in place and that the integrity of
the data is always guaranteed.

 

**Name: Common Vocabulary and Data Definitions**

*Statement*: Data is defined consistently throughout the enterprise and
the definitions are understandle and available to all users.

*Rational*: A common dictionary will facilitate communication and enable
dialog to be effective.

*Implications*: The business must co-ordinate a business wide glossary

 

**Name: Ease-of-Use**

*Statement*: Applications are easy to user. The underlying technology is
transparent to users, so they can concentrate on tasks at hand.

*Rational*: The user should be aware and understand only the integrated
information environment provided. Knowledge of underlying technologies
or the requirement to move out of the integrated environment will hinder
productiticy and increase training.

*Implications*: The business must co-ordinate a business wide glossary.

 

**Name: Interoperability**

*Rational*: Standards help with consistency, integration and potential
migration to another systems that support the same standards.

*Implications*: The IT function must ensure interoperatiblity and
standards adherence is considered when undertaking any technical
selection.
